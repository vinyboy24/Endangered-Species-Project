        <summary>Habitat & Ecosystem</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The black-footed ferret lives in the grasslands and prairies of North America, especially in areas with large prairie dog colonies. These regions are usually dry or semi-dry, with hot summers, cold winters, and moderate rainfall. The ecosystem is mostly open plains with grasses and few trees. Black-footed ferrets depend on prairie dog burrows for shelter and protection.</p>

        <summary>Characteristics & Adaptations</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Black-footed ferrets have a long, slender body that helps them move easily through prairie dog tunnels. Their sharp claws and teeth are adapted for catching small mammals. Their tan fur with black feet and a black face mask helps them blend into their environment. They also have good night vision because they are mostly active at night.</p>

        <summary>Niche (Role in the Ecosystem)</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The black-footed ferret helps keep prairie dog populations from growing too large, which protects grasses and keeps the prairie ecosystem balanced. It is also an indicator species, meaning its presence shows that the grassland ecosystem is healthy.</p>

          <p><strong>What eats the black-footed ferret:</strong> Coyotes, owls, eagles, and badgers.</p>
          <p><strong>Prairie dogs eat:</strong> Grasses and plants.</p>
          <p><strong>Plants get energy from:</strong> The sun.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>There are only a few hundred black-footed ferrets living in the wild today, with more in captive breeding programs.</p>

        <summary>Endangered Status & Causes</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The black-footed ferret was listed as endangered in 1967. It became endangered mainly because prairie dogs were killed off, which removed its main food source and destroyed its habitat. Disease and habitat loss also greatly reduced its population.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>Why It Matters</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>If the black-footed ferret becomes extinct, prairie dog populations could grow too large and damage grasslands. This would upset the balance of the ecosystem and harm many other plants and animals that depend on healthy prairie habitats.</p>

        <summary>What Is Being Done to Help</summary>
        <div class="content">
          <p>Scientists use captive breeding programs to increase the population and release ferrets back into protected areas. Laws such as the Endangered Species Act help protect the ferret and its habitat. People can help by supporting conservation programs and protecting prairie ecosystems.</p>
